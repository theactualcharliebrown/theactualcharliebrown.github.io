      <h4>Career Goals Blog</h4>

      <p>
        Having worked in many aspects of the heavy side of industry, I have
        experienced quite the steep learning curve in my decision to persue a
        new dicipline.
      </p>
      <p>
        My current goal is to complete this
        <a href="https://www.correlation-one.com/amazon-software-development"
          >Correlation 1 Softftware Development</a
        >
        course and eventually become a Full Stack Developer.

      <h4>The Latest</h4>
      <p>
        6/2/23: We're currently learning about the user-centered design process
        and how it affects a website. We are also working on Search Engine
        Optimization (SEO) and how to properly implement it into our code.
        <br />
        I never knew how much research and work went into making a successful
        website optimized for search engines.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        5/24/23: Professional Development Session #2 was very helpful in
        bringing me up to speed on the most successful way to create a resume.
        We also touched on LinkedIn and its usefulness in networking and job
        searching.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        5/10/23: Our cohort just wrapped up Into To and Advanced CSS modules.
        CCS is the acronym for Cascading Style Sheet and is a styling language
        that is used to determine the appearance and formatting of a document
        written in a markup language. CSS handles all of the page's fonts,
        spacing, and colors, making it more attractive and easier to read. It
        was very interesting to learn how CSS works with HTML to add style to
        the basic structure of the HTML page.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        4/26/23: We just finished our first Career Development lecture and it
        was very eye-opening for me as the method at which roles are secured has
        changed since the last time I actively searched for a new job.<br />We've
        been learning Advanced HTML Elements and are now able to create pages
        like this one by using various tags and other tools.<br />The most
        encouraging aspect of this program is not only the support of the
        Correlation 1 team, but the support of the other students in the
        program.
